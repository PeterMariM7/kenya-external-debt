# Kenya External Debt Analysis (2010â€“2024)

This project analyzes Kenya's external debt from 2010 to 2024 using data from the World Bank API. It extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) the data into a PostgreSQL database. A Grafana dashboard provides two visual panels: one for total debt trend and another for year-over-year change.

---

## Repository Contents

- `kenyadebt.ipynb`: Python script to extract, transform, and load data
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries required to run the script
- `grafana-screenshots/`: Two PNGs showing Grafana dashboards
- `schema.sql`: SQL used to set up the target PostgreSQL table (optional)

SELECT 
  TO_DATE(year || '-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS time,
  debt / 1000000 AS debt_million_usd
FROM "Kenya_Debt".kenya_external_debt
WHERE debt IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY time;

## for the line chart
